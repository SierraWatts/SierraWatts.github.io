          <p>I would say that I have a few things that I am especially good at, one being my determination. I would say that I am a very determined person. When I set my mind to something I am determined to achieve that goal no matter the hard work that it takes to get there. Another strength that I posses is Emotional Intelligence.

          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <h5>219&degC (426&degF)</h5>
          <p>One weakness of mine that I especially struggle with is Time Management. I often catch myself spending way too much time on one activity which decreases my productivity. Another weakness of mine would my ability to have paitience. When I feel that things are taking too long or not going the way I would hope, I quickly get unpaitient with the situation.</p>
